# Bika Lims Custom Statistics API

## Installation and Usage Guide

1. Make sure you have python Installed. You can download it from here: 
	```
	https://www.python.org/downloads

	Download distribution specific to your system: 64bit OR 32bit (x86)
	```
My Personal favourite distribution is obtained from here: 
	```
	https://www.continuum.io/downloads
	```

2. If you have downloaded the python.org distribution you may want to install the requests package. Open your console and type the following to install.

	```
	pip install requests
	
	Then Press Enter and it will be installed if not already included in the distribution.
	```

3. Install the API in any Location of your choice. Start the console and run the following code:
	```
	git clone https://github.com/aurthurm/bika-api
	````
4. To use the api type the folowig commands in your console:
	```
	python bika-api\bikaapi

	You are good to go! 
	```
6. When you use the API your data will be located in .../Documents/Bika LIMS/...
7. For the Console i prefer cmder to cmd in windows. To install cmder you can download it from here:
	```
	https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases/download/v1.3.2/cmder.zip
	```
8. Create a folder in C:/ directory called 'tools' *(small letters)*. Unzip the installed cmder inside this directory. Go and download this cmder registry file and double click to install: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jojobyte/66c8346ed8948b9b395f/raw/cf00c0a36f7df319eb231b585c612494aff0484c/ContextCmder-Enable.reg Now, cmder should be accessible in Context (Right-Click) Menu anywhere from your system
